### 4.2 Design principles

To effectively translate the [European Digital Identity Regulation] into a
User-friendly, privacy-focused, and secure technical architecture, establishing
design principles is crucial. These principles, rooted in the regulatory
framework and enriched by industry best practices, will serve as fundamental
guidelines. This approach ensures compliance with requirements emphasising
User-centricity, accessibility, privacy, security, and cross-border
interoperability. It demonstrates a commitment to both regulatory alignment and
excellence in the EUDI Wallet architecture's design.

#### 4.2.1 User-centricity

The EUDI Wallet ecosystem prioritises User-centricity as a core design
principle. This means placing User needs and experience at the forefront of
every design decision. The Wallet Unit should be intuitive and easy to use, with
seamless integration into existing use cases. Wallet Units make it easy for
Users to exercise their legal rights to full control over their attributes and
privacy, with transparent information about what attributes are being presented
and to whom. Additionally, the Wallet Unit should be accessible and inclusive,
catering to Users with varying technical backgrounds and abilities. By
prioritising User-centricity, the EUDI Wallet ecosystem fosters trust and
encourages widespread adoption, ultimately achieving its goal of empowering
Users with secure and convenient digital identity management.

#### 4.2.2 Accessibility

Regarding the accessibility of Wallet Units for Users, it is essential to ensure
that Wallet Units are inclusive by design and fully aligned with the
applicable European legal and technical frameworks on accessibility. The same
applies to any other User-facing component of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, such as
websites and User authentication methods of PID Providers and Attestation
Providers, registries (see [Section 3.17](#317-registrars)), et cetera. This is
not only a matter of legal compliance but also a fundamental component of
ensuring equal access, User trust, and widespread adoption across all segments
of the population, including persons with disabilities.

For more information, please refer to [Chapter 8](#8-accessibility).

#### 4.2.3 Interoperability

The EUDI Wallet ecosystem prioritises interoperability as a core design
principle. This ensures a Wallet Unit functions seamlessly across borders within
the EU. Users can travel freely and confidently utilise their digital identity
wallets for various services, from e-government platforms to private online
interactions. Interoperability fosters secure data exchange through standardised
protocols, allowing trusted entities to verify credentials effortlessly. This
not only simplifies the User experience but also strengthens overall security
within the system. Moreover, interoperability prevents market fragmentation by
creating a level playing field for different Wallet Solutions. It fosters
competition and collaboration, ultimately driving innovation in the EUDI Wallet
ecosystem. By prioritising interoperability, the EUDI Wallet architecture lays
the foundation for a trusted and universally accepted EUDI Wallet ecosystem
across the EU.

#### 4.2.4 Privacy by design

The EUDI Wallet architecture embodies the principle of privacy by design. This
means that the protection of User data is a fundamental pillar of the
architecture's design. The principle of data minimisation guides the collection
of personal information, ensuring that Relying Parties gather only the
attributes they need and have registered for. By enabling selective disclosure
of attributes, the Wallet Unit empowers Users with granular control over what
data is presented and to whom. Transparency is built into the system, with clear
explanations of how data is used and protected. By making privacy a cornerstone
from the beginning, the EUDI Wallet ecosystem aims to foster trust and protect
the fundamental rights of its Users. Finally, measures are taken to prevent
Users from being tracked by Relying Parties, PID Providers, or Attestation
Providers.

For more information, please refer to [Sections 7.4.3.4](#7434-risks-and-mitigation-measures-related-to-authorisation)
and [7.4.3.5](#7435-risks-and-mitigation-measures-related-to-user-privacy).

#### 4.2.5 Security by design

The EUDI Wallet architecture embraces the principle of security by design. This
means security considerations are woven into the very fabric of the
architecture's design. Throughout the design process, potential vulnerabilities
are identified and mitigated. Secure coding practices are mandated, and the
architecture itself minimises attack surfaces by compartmentalising sensitive
data and access controls. By prioritising security from the outset, the EUDI
Wallet architecture aims to be inherently resistant to cyberattacks and data
breaches, fostering trust and User confidence in this EUDI Wallet ecosystem.

For more information, please refer to [Sections 7.4.3.2](#7432-risks-and-mitigation-measures-related-to-confidentiality-integrity-and-authenticity)
and [7.4.3.3](#7433-risks-and-mitigation-measures-related-to-tampering-of-cryptographic-keys-and-sensitive-data).

### 4.3 Reference architecture

#### 4.3.1 Overview

The figure below gives an overview of the architecture of the EUDI Wallet
ecosystem and its components. In comparison to [Figure 1](#31-introduction),
this figure presents more detail on the composition of a Wallet Unit and its
interfaces to other entities. The depicted components of a Wallet Unit are
described in [Section 4.3.2](#432-components-of-a-wallet-unit),
while the interfaces are described in [Section 4.3.3](#433-wallet-unit-interfaces-and-protocols).
The other entities shown in the figure were already described in [Chapter 3](#3-roles-within-the-eudi-wallet-ecosystem).

![Figure 2](media/Figure_2_High-Level_Architecture.png)
*Figure 2: EUDI Wallet ecosystem reference architecture*

Figure 2 shows the high-level components and interfaces of the EUDI Wallet
ecosystem. The **Wallet Unit** is shown interacting with external entities through standardized
protocols for its entire lifecycle. The components of the Wallet Unit are
detailed in [Section 4.3.2](#432-components-of-a-wallet-unit).

Note that a User device can host more than one Wallet Instance, either provided
by multiple Wallet Providers or by the same one, if supported by that Wallet
Provider. If a User device hosts multiple Wallet Instances, it is part of
multiple Wallet Units. In such a case, all requirements in this ARF for a single
Wallet Unit and its components apply to each one independently.

#### 4.3.2 Components of a Wallet Unit

The following have been identified as the core components of a Wallet Unit:

- **User device**: A User Device comprises the hardware, operating system,
and software environment required to host and execute the Wallet Instance. The
minimum hardware and software requirements for the User device will be
determined by the Wallet Provider.

- **Wallet Instance**: The app or application installed on a User device,
which is an instance of a Wallet Solution and belongs to and is controlled by a
User. This component implements the core business logic and interfaces as
depicted in Figure 2. It directly interacts with the WSCA (which is interacting
with the WSCD, see bullets hereafter) to securely manage critical assets and
execute cryptographic functions. It interfaces with one or more key stores for
the management of non-critical cryptographic assets.

- **Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device (WSCD)**: A tamper-resistant device that
provides an environment that is linked to and used by the Wallet Secure
Cryptographic Application (WSCA) to protect critical assets and to securely
execute cryptographic functions. This includes a keystore, but also the
environment where the security-critical functions are executed. The WSCD is
tamper-proof and duplication-proof. In fact, [CIR 2024/2981], Annex IV, section
2 (3) states "As a prerequisite to the certification under national
certification schemes, the WSCD shall be assessed against the requirements of
assurance level high as set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502".
Therefore, a WSCD by legal definition complies with requirements of LoA High.
One WSCD may be a part of multiple Wallet Units, e.g. in case of a remote HSM.
The WSCD consists of two parts: the WSCD hardware covers the hardware issued by
the WSCD vendor and the WSCD firmware covers security-related software, such as
an operating system and cryptographic libraries provided by the WSCD vendor.
Figure 2 shows four different possible security architectures for the WSCD (for
more details see [Section 4.5](#45-wscd-architecture-types)):
    - a remote WSCD, which is a remote device, such as a Hardware Security
    Module (HSM), accessed over a network.
    - a local external WSCD, which is an external device, such as a smart card issued
    to the User specifically for this purpose,
    - a local internal WSCD, which is a component within the User device, such
    as a SIM, e-SIM, or embedded Secure Element,
    - a local native WSCD, which is a component embedded in the User device and
    accessed via an API provided by the operating system.

- **Wallet Secure Cryptographic Application (WSCA)**: an application that
manages critical assets by being linked to and using the cryptographic and
non-cryptographic functions provided by the Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device.
Different types of WSCD generally use different types of WSCA. For example, if
the WSCD is a remote HSM, the WSCA may be (but does not have to be) a dedicated
firmware module. If the WSCD is a external smartcard or an internal e-SIM or
embedded Secure Element, the WSCA takes the form of a dedicated Java Card applet
running on the smart card, e-SIM, or SE. If the WSCD is a local native WSCD, the
WSCA is integrated into the OS of the User device. In all cases, the WSCA
interfaces directly with the Wallet Instance. For more details see [Section 4.5](#45-wscd-architecture-types).

- **Keystore**: In addition to a WSCA/WSCD, a Wallet Unit may also have
available one or more other keystores. A keystore is a hardware-backed
repository and service in which non-critical cryptographic assets are generated,
stored, and used exclusively inside a dedicated hardware security boundary.
Examples of a keystore include a Secure Element, a TPM, TEE, or secure enclave,
or a remote HSM. Depending on its implementation, a keystore is associated with
a certain level of security, classified, for example, according to ISO/IEC 18045.
A keystore cannot be used for PID keys, since these must be managed on
Level of Assurance High, which can only be done using a WSCA/WSCD. See [Section 2.2](#22-identification-and-authentication)
for the distinction between 'Level of Assurance' and 'level of security'.

- **Local QSCD**: The Wallet Unit may contain a local QSCD. In principle, a
local QSCD can be be the same component as the WSCD. Or, to put it differently,
a single component can implement both the QSCD and the WSCD functionality.
However, in such case that component must be certified both as QSCD and as WSCD.
Alternatively, a local QSCD can also be a separate component, for example a
dedicated smart card, that is connected to the Wallet Unit. If a local QSCD is
available to the Wallet Unit, it is provided by the Wallet Provider, and the
Wallet Provider is responsible for ensuring the correct functioning of the
Wallet Instance and the local QSCD when creating a signature.

- **Wallet Provider backend**: The Wallet Provider backend offers Users support
with their Wallet Units, performs essential maintenance, and issues Wallet Unit
Attestations through the Wallet Provider Interface. Maintenance provided by the
Wallet Provider is discussed in more detail in the [discussion paper for Topic
T](./discussion-topics/t-support-and-maintenance-by-the-wallet-provider.md) and
in [Section
6.5.3.2](#6532-wallet-provider-requests-data-about-the-users-device-from-the-wallet-instance).
High-level requirements are in included in [Topic
56](./annexes/annex-2/annex-2.02-high-level-requirements-by-topic.md#a2334-topic-56---wallet-provider-support-and-maintenance)
in Annex 2.

#### 4.3.3 Wallet Unit interfaces and protocols

Figure 2 shows the following interfaces between components of a Wallet Unit, or
between the Wallet Unit and other entities in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem:

- The **Wallet Provider Interface** is used by the Wallet Instance to
communicate with the Wallet Provider to request and issue the Wallet Unit
Attestation, as well as to provide support to the User and collect aggregated
and User-consented information in a privacy-preserving manner to provision the
Wallet Unit, in compliance with applicable legislation. Because the Wallet
Provider is responsible for both sides of this interface, it will not be
standardised in the scope of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.

- The **User Interface** is the point of interaction and communication
between the User and the Wallet Instance. This interface will not be
standardised in the scope of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.

- The **Presentation Interface** enables Relying Party Instances to securely
request and receive PIDs, QEAAs, PuB-EAAs and EAAs from Wallet Units. This
interface accommodates both remote and proximity interactions. For remote
presentation flows, as detailed in [Section 4.4.3](#443-remote-presentation-transaction-flows),
the Wallet Instance implements the OpenID for Verifiable Presentation protocol
[OpenID4VP] in combination with the [W3C Digital Credentials API]. In contrast,
for the proximity presentation flow, this interface adheres to the [ISO/IEC 18013-5]
standard, see [Section 4.4.2](#442-proximity-presentation-flows).
The same interface can also be used by another Wallet Unit to request User attributes,
see [Section 6.6.4](#664-pid-or-attestation-presentation-to-another-wallet-unit).

- The **Secure Cryptographic Interface** enables the Wallet Unit to
communicate with the Wallet Secure Cryptographic Application (WSCA). This
interface is specifically designed for managing cryptographic assets and
executing cryptographic functions. In case the WSCA is delivered by the Wallet
Provider, the Wallet Provider is responsible for both sides of this interface,
and hence standardisation is not needed within the scope of the EUDI Wallet
ecosystem. In case the WSCA is delivered by the provider of the WSCD, this
interface will comply with an existing specification that is not specifically
designed for the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. Rather, each type of WSCA/WSCD will
expose a provider-defined interface to the Wallet Units. For example, in case
the WSCD is a secure element, [CIR 2024/2979] requires support for the [GP
OMAPI] interface specification (or an equivalent one). To be able to support
different types of WSCA/WSCD, Wallet Units may therefore need to be able to
handle multiple flavours of this interface.

- The **WSCA - WSCD Interface** enables the WSCA to communicate with the
WSCD. This interface is not specifically designed for the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.
Rather, each type of WSCD will expose a manufacturer-defined interface to the
WSCA making use of it, for example syscalls of the operating system. In case the
WSCA is delivered by the Wallet Provider, the Wallet Provider is responsible for
correctly implementing this interface.

- The **PID Issuance Interface** complies with the [OpenID4VCI] standard
and is used when the Wallet Unit communicates with a PID Provider to request and
receive PIDs to be stored within the Wallet Unit.

- The **Attestation Issuance Interface** complies with the
[OpenID4VCI] standard and is used by the Wallet Unit to request various
attestations that the User wants to include in their Wallet Unit.

- The **Remote Signing or Sealing Interface** facilitates communication
between the Wallet Unit and a Qualified Electronic Signature Remote
Creation (QESRC) Provider. This interface is used by the Wallet Unit to generate
a qualified electronic signature or seal.

>*Note that the "Attribute Deletion Request to Relying Party Interface" and the
"Reporting Relying Party to DPA Interface", which are mentioned in the
Regulation, are not depicted as interfaces in Figure 2. Functionality enabling a
User to request a Relying Party to delete personal data (i.e., User attributes)
obtained from the User's Wallet Unit is seen as a feature of the Wallet
Solution. The same applies to functionalities enabling the User to report a
Relying Party to a Data Protection Authority.

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Document scope and purpose

This document is the natural-person Person Identification Data (PID) Rulebook
and is part of the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF). It specifies
how the mandatory and optional person identification data for the natural
person, as defined in Tables 1 and 2 in the Annex of the Commission Implementing
Regulation on PID and EAA [CIR 2024/2977], as well as the metadata specified in
Table 5 of that CIR, will be encoded within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem.
Additionally, this document specifies further optional PID attributes that are
not included in the CIR.

This document also specifies how a PID and all attributes in it are encoded if
the PID complies with [ISO/IEC 18013-5] and if it complies with [SD-JWT VC].

This PID Rulebook should be read in conjunction with the high-level requirements for PIDs in [Topic 3](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2.02-high-level-requirements-by-topic.md#a232-topic-3---pid-rulebook) in Annex 2 of the Architecture Reference Framework. In particular, the values to be used for the namespace and document type for [ISO/IEC 18013-5]-compliant PIDs and for the vct claim in [SD-JWT VC]-compliant PIDs are defined in Topic 3.

Person identification data for the legal person is out of scope of this document.

### 1.2 Document structure

This PID Rulebook is structured as follows:

- [Chapter 2](#2-pid-attributes-and-metadata) describes the PID attributes and
metadata on a generic level, regardless of the encoding used for the PID. Most
of the content of this chapter is a direct copy of the Annex of Commission
Implementing Regulation 2024/2977 on PID and EAA. However, a few additional
attributes are specified in this chapter.
- [Chapter 3](#3-isoiec-18013-5-compliant-encoding-of-pid) specifies how the PID
attributes and metadata are encoded in case the PID complies with [ISO/IEC
18013-5].
- [Chapter 4](#4-sd-jwt-vc-based-encoding-of-pid) specifies how the PID
attributes and metadata are encoded in case the PID complies with [SD-JWT VC].
- [Chapter 5](#5-pid-usage) specifies how PIDs are issued and used.
- [Chapter 6](#6-trust-anchors) discusses mechanisms for the provision of trust anchors that shall be used for the verification of PIDs.
- [Chapter 7](#7-revocation) discusses how PIDs can be revoked, and how Relying Parties can perform revocation checking.
- [Chapter 8](#8-compliance) states how this PID Rulebook complies with the general EUDI framework, the ARF, and relevant Regulations.

### 1.3 Key words

This document uses the capitalised key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in [RFC 2119], i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and
options specified in this document.

In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, i.e., a requirement that is not mandated by this document, but, for
instance, by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability,
whereas other words, such as 'will', and 'is' or 'are' are intended as
statements of fact.

### 1.4 Terminology

This document uses the terminology specified in [Annex 1](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-1/annex-1-definitions.md) of the ARF.

## 2 PID attributes and metadata

### 2.1 Introduction

Sections [2.2](#22-mandatory-attributes-specified-in-cir-20242977), [2.3](#23-optional-attributes-specified-in-cir-20242977), [2.4](#24-mandatory-metadata-specified-in-cir-20242977) and [2.5](#26-additional-optional-attributes-specified-in-this-rulebook) of this chapter list the mandatory and optional
PID attributes and PID metadata defined in CIR 2024/2977. [Section 2.6](#26-additional-optional-attributes-specified-in-this-rulebook) lists the optional PID attributes additionally defined in this PID Rulebook.

Note that, when requesting PID attributes from a Wallet Unit, a Relying Party is not required to request all mandatory attributes. Also, a User is allowed to refuse to present a mandatory attribute, if it is requested by a Relying Party.

The data identifiers and definitions given in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5
are identical to those in (the updated version of) [CIR 2024/2977], except where explicitly indicated that
some further explanations have been added in this Rulebook.

All data identifiers and definitions in this chapter are independent of any
encoding used. Consequently,

- the data identifiers in these tables are not necessarily the same as the
attribute identifiers used for PIDs complying with [ISO/IEC 18013-5]. [Chapter 3](#3-isoiec-18013-5-compliant-encoding-of-pid) specifies the attribute
identifiers to be used for PIDs in [ISO/IEC 18013-5] format
- the data identifiers in these tables are not necessarily the same as the claim
names used for PIDs complying with [SD-JWT VC]. [Chapter 4](#4-sd-jwt-vc-based-encoding-of-pid) specifies the claim names to be used for such PIDs.

Note that the data type for each attribute is not specified in this chapter, but in [Chapter 3](#3-isoiec-18013-5-compliant-encoding-of-pid) and [Chapter 4](#4-sd-jwt-vc-based-encoding-of-pid).

### 2.2 Mandatory attributes specified in CIR 2024/2977

In case the user opts out, empty, as specified in PID_03 in [Topic 3](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2.02-high-level-requirements-by-topic.md#a232-topic-3---pid-rulebook) in Annex 2 of the ARF. | - |

### 2.3 Optional attributes specified in CIR 2024/2977

| **Data Identifier** | **Definition** |**Example value** |
|------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| resident_address | The full address of the place where the user to whom the person identification data relates currently resides or can be contacted (street name, house number, city etc.). | Rietveld 1, 2312 JD, Leiden |
| resident_country | The country where the user to whom the person identification data relates currently resides, as an alpha-2 country code as specified in [ISO 3166-1]. | NL |
| resident_state | The state, province, district, or local area where the user to whom the person identification data relates currently resides. | Zuid-Holland |
| resident_city | The municipality, city, town, or village where the user to whom the person identification data relates currently resides. | Leiden |

| personal_administrative_number | A value assigned to the user to whom the person identification data relates that is unique among all personal administrative numbers issued by the provider of person identification data. Where Member States opt to include this attribute, they shall describe in their electronic identification schemes under which the person identification data is issued, the policy that they apply to the values of this attribute, including, where applicable, specific conditions for the processing of this value. | 123456782 |
| family_name_birth | Last name(s) or surname(s) of the User to whom the person identification data relates at the time of birth. | Poepjes |
| given_name_birth | First name(s), including middle name(s), of the User to whom the person identification data relates at the time of birth. | Björn |
| sex | Values shall be one of the following: 0 = not known; 1 = male; 2 = female; 3 = other; 4 = inter; 5 = diverse; 6 = open; 9 = not applicable. For values 0, 1, 2 and 9, [ISO/IEC 5218] applies. | 1 |
| email_address | Electronic mail address of the user to whom the person identification data relates, in conformance with [RFC 5322]. | <wijnandthart@example.com> |
| mobile_phone_number | Mobile telephone number of the User to whom the person identification data relates, starting with the '+' symbol as the international code prefix and the country code, followed by numbers only. | +31123456789 |

### 2.4 Mandatory metadata specified in CIR 2024/2977

| **Data Identifier** | **Definition** |**Example value** |
|------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| issuing_authority | Name of the administrative authority that issued the person identification data, or the [ISO 3166-1] alpha-2 country code of the respective Member State if there is no separate authority entitled to issue person identification data. | Rijksdienst voor Identiteitsgegevens |
| issuing_country | Alpha-2 country code, as specified in [ISO 3166-1], of the country or territory of the provider of the person identification data. | NL |

### 2.5 Optional metadata specified in CIR 2024/2977

| **Data Identifier** | **Definition** |**Example value** |
|------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| expiry_date | Date (and if possible time) when the administrative validity period of the person identification data will expire. **Further clarification added in this PID Rulebook:** This attribute, as well as `issuance_date`, pertains to the administrative validity period of the logical PID. It is up to the PID Provider to decide whether the logical PID has an administrative validity period. However, if present, it in general is different from the technical validity period of a technical PID. The technical validity period is a mandatory element of all technical PIDs (and also attestations) in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. It typically is short, a few days or weeks at most, if not shorter, to mitigate challenges regarding tracking of Users by malicious Relying Parties based on the repeated presentation of the same PID. On the other hand, the administrative validity period is typically at least a few years long. During the administrative validity period of a logical PID, the PID Provider will therefore provide multiple successive technical PIDs to a User, typically without any actions being expected from the User. However, when the administrative validity period of a logical PID ends, typically the User has to apply for a new logical PID.| 19-12-2035 |
| document_number | A number for the person identification data, assigned by the provider of person identification data. | A01234567 |
| issuing_jurisdiction | Country subdivision code of the jurisdiction that issued the person identification data, as specified in [ISO 3166-2], Clause 8. The first part of the code shall be the same as the value for the issuing country. | NL |
| issuance_date | Date (and if possible time) when the person identification data was issued and/or the administrative validity period of the person identification data began. See also the clarification for `expiry_date`. | 19-12-2025 |

### 2.6 Additional optional attributes specified in this Rulebook

| **Data Identifier** | **Definition** |**Example value** |
|------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| trust_anchor | This attribute indicates at least the URL at which a machine-readable version of the trust anchor to be used for verifying the PID can be found or looked up. *Note: This attribute corresponds to the location meant in Annex V point h) or Annex VII point h) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation], which is mandatory for QEAAs. This PID Rulebook adds this as an optional attribute for PIDs as well, so PID Providers are able to ensure that PIDs can be validated by Relying Parties in the same manner as QEAAs.* | <https://example.com/trustanchors/pid/> |
| attestation_legal_category | This attribute indicates that a PID has indeed been issued as a PID. *Note: According to Annex V point a) and Annex VII point a) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] an indication, at least in a form suitable for automated processing, that the attestation has been issued as a QEAA or Pub-EAA SHALL be defined. This PID Rulebook adds this as an optional attribute for PIDs as well, so PID Providers are able to ensure that PIDs can be validated by Relying Parties in the same manner as QEAAs.* | PID |

## 3 ISO/IEC 18013-5-compliant encoding of PID

### 3.1 Encoding of PID attributes and metadata

#### 3.1.1 Document type and namespace

As specified in [Topic 3](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2.02-high-level-requirements-by-topic.md#a232-topic-3---pid-rulebook) in Annex 2 of the ARF, "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1" will be used as the attestation type for [ISO/IEC 18013-5]-compliant PIDs.

Similarly, "eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1" will be used for the namespace of the attributes specified below.

#### 3.1.2 Attributes overview

The [ISO/IEC 18013-5]-compliant encoding of PID attributes and metadata is
specified in the table below. The table contains the following information for
all attributes:

- The first column lists the data identifier specified in
[Chapter 2](#2-pid-attributes-and-metadata) above.
- The second column lists the corresponding attribute identifier to be used in
presentation requests and responses according to [ISO/IEC 18013-5].
- The third column indicates the encoding of each attribute. This column uses
CDDL representation types defined in [RFC 8610]. The following notes and
requirements apply:
    - `tstr`, `uint`, `bstr`, `bool` and `tdate` are CDDL representation types defined in [RFC 8610].
    - Regarding type `tstr`: this document confirms that, as specified in [RFC
    8949], a `tstr` SHALL be encoded in UTF-8 and SHALL support the full Unicode
    range.
    - All attributes having encoding type `tstr` SHALL have a maximum length of
    150 characters.
    - This document specifies `full-date` as `full-date = #6.1004(tstr)`, where tag
    1004 is specified in [RFC 8943].
    - In accordance with [RFC 8949], section 3.4.1, a `tdate` attribute SHALL
    contain a date-time string as specified in [RFC 3339]. In accordance with
    [RFC 8943], a `full-date` attribute SHALL contain a full-date string as
    specified in [RFC 3339].
    - The following requirements apply to the representation of dates in
    attributes, unless otherwise indicated:
        - Fractions of seconds SHALL NOT be used;
        - A local offset from UTC SHALL NOT be used; the time-offset defined in
        [RFC 3339] SHALL be set to "Z".
    - [RFC 8949], section 4.2, describes four rules for canonical CBOR. Three of
    those rules SHALL be implemented for all CBOR structures in PIDs, as
    follows:
        - integers (major types 0 and 1) SHALL be as small as possible;
        - the expression of the length in a `bstr`, `tstr`, array or map SHALL be as
        short as possible;
        - indefinite-length items SHALL be made into definite-length items.

Note that the presence of each attribute (mandatory or optional) is already specified in [Chapter 2](#2-pid-attributes-and-metadata) above.

| **Data Identifier** | **Attribute identifier** | **Encoding format** |
|------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| family_name | family_name | `tstr` |
| given_name | given_name | `tstr` |
| birth_date | birth_date | `full-date` |
| birth_place | place_of_birth | `place_of_birth`, see [Section 3.1.4](#314-attribute-place_of_birth) |
| nationality | nationality | `nationalities`, see [Section 3.1.3](#313-attribute-nationality) |
| resident_address | resident_address | `tstr` |
| resident_country | resident_country | `tstr` |
| resident_state | resident_state | `tstr` |
| resident_city | resident_city | `tstr` |
| resident_postal_code | resident_postal_code | `tstr` |
| resident_street | resident_street | `tstr` |
| personal_administrative_number | personal_administrative_number | `tstr` |
| portrait | portrait | `bstr`|
| family_name_birth | family_name_birth | `tstr` |
| given_name_birth | given_name_birth | `tstr` |
| sex | sex | `uint`; see additional information in [Section 2.3](#23-optional-attributes-specified-in-cir-20242977)  |
| email_address | email_address | `tstr` |
| mobile_phone_number | mobile_phone_number | `tstr` |
| expiry_date | expiry_date | `tdate` or `full-date` |
| issuing_authority | issuing_authority | `tstr` |
| issuing_country | issuing_country | `tstr` |
| document_number | document_number | `tstr` |
| issuing_jurisdiction | issuing_jurisdiction | `tstr` |
| issuance_date | issuance_date | `tdate` or `full-date` |
| trust_anchor | trust_anchor | `tstr` |
| attestation_legal_category | attestation_legal_category | `tstr` |

#### 3.1.3 Attribute nationality

The attribute nationality is encoded as a type `nationalities`, i.e., an array of Alpha-2 country codes as specified in [ISO 3166-1]. Using CDDL notation as specified in [RFC 8610], the
encoding of this attribute is:

`` cddl
nationalities = [+ CountryCode]

CountryCode = tstr ; Alpha-2 country code specified in [ISO 3166-1]
``

Note: If the User to whom the person identification data relates has multiple
nationalities (and the PID Provider is willing to attest to these multiple
nationalities), the PID Provider can include all of the nationalities in the
nationalities array. A potential drawback of this solution is that the User
cannot selectively disclose only one of these nationalities, since for [ISO/IEC
18013-5]-compliant attestations, always the entire array will be presented if the
User approves the presentation of the nationality attribute. A potential
solution to this challenge is for the PID Provider to include only one
nationality in the nationality attribute, and for the remaining nationalities
use one or more domestic data attributes specified according to requirement
PID_06 in [Annex 2, Topic 3](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2.02-high-level-requirements-by-topic.md#a232-topic-3---pid-rulebook).


#### 3.1.4 Attribute place_of_birth

The attribute place_of_birth is encoded as a type `place_of_birth`.
Using CDDL notation as specified in [RFC 8610], the encoding of this attribute is:
  
`` cddl
place_of_birth =
{
  ? "country": tstr  ; a single alpha-2 country code as specified in [ISO 3166-1]
  ? "region": tstr   ; the name of a state, province, district, or local area
  ? "locality": tstr ; the name of a municipality, city, town, or village
}
``

place_of_birth SHALL contain at least one of the following key-value pairs: `"country"`, `"region"`, or `"locality"`.

## 4 SD-JWT VC-based encoding of PID

### 4.1 Encoding of PID attributes and metadata

#### 4.1.1 Overview

Following requirement ARB_06b, SD-JWT VC-encoded PIDs use claim names that are either registered in the JSON Web
Token Claims Registry [IANA-JWT-Claims], are Public Names as defined in [RFC 7519], or are Private Names specific
to the attestation type. The tables below map the data
identifiers defined above to the corresponding claim names and specify the encoding format of the claim value.

A JSON string used in an SD-JWT VC-encoded PID SHALL be encoded in UTF-8 and SHALL support the full Unicode range, unless explicitly specified otherwise in the tables below or the references therein.

Note that a hierarchical claim name structure can be used in SD-JWT VC encoded
PIDs as SD-JWT allows for individual selective disclosure of objects
and their properties. A hierarchical claim name structure is indicated by the
notation `parent.child` in the tables below.

The following IANA-registered claim names are to be used for PIDs:

| **Data Identifier** | **Attribute identifier** | **Encoding format** |**Reference/Notes** |
|-------------------- |--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| family_name | family_name | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| given_name | given_name | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| birth_date | birthdate | string, [ISO 8601-1] YYYY-MM-DD format | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| birth_place | place_of_birth | JSON structure | Section 4.1 of [EKYC];  At least one of the members (country, region or locality) SHALL be present in the JSON structure |
| nationality | nationalities | array of strings | Section 4.1 of [EKYC]; using alpha-2 country codes as defined in [Section 2.2](#22-mandatory-attributes-specified-in-cir-20242977) |
| resident_address | address.formatted | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| resident_country | address.country | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| resident_state | address.region | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| resident_city | address.locality | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| resident_postal_code | address.postal_code | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| resident_street | address.street_address | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| family_name_birth | birth_family_name | string | Section 4.1 of [EKYC] |
| given_name_birth | birth_given_name | string | Section 4.1 of [EKYC] |
| email_address | email | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| mobile_phone_number | phone_number | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |
| portrait | picture | string; data URL containing the base64-encoded portrait in JPEG format | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] |

Note: The standard JWT claims nbf and exp are used to express the technical validity period of a SD-JWT VC-compliant PID.

The following Private Names specific to the attestation type defined in this document are to be used for PIDs:

| **Data Identifier** | **Attribute identifier** | **Encoding format** | **Notes** |
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| expiry_date | date_of_expiry | string | [ISO 8601-1] YYYY-MM-DD format, as defined in Section 5.4.4.2 of [EKYC Schema] |
| issuance_date | date_of_issuance | string | [ISO 8601-1] YYYY-MM-DD format, as defined in Section 5.4.4.2 of [EKYC Schema] |
| personal_administrative_number | personal_administrative_number | string | |
| sex | sex | number | Numeric encoding as described in [Section 2.3](#23-optional-attributes-specified-in-cir-20242977); `gender` from [OIDC] uses a different value range and is therefore not used |
| resident_house_number | address.house_number | string | This document extends the specification of `address` in [OIDC] with an additional member `address.house_number` |
| issuing_authority | issuing_authority | string | |
| issuing_country | issuing_country | string | |
| document_number | document_number | string | |
| issuing_jurisdiction | issuing_jurisdiction | string | |
| trust_anchor | trust_anchor | string | |
| attestation_legal_category | attestation_legal_category | string | |

### 4.2 Note on VCT

SD-JWT VC defines the Verifiable Credential Type (`vct`). A type comes
with associated metadata that, for instance, provides information about
the type itself, outlines a schema detailing the claims that are
optional or mandatory in the SD-JWT VC, and specifies their display
methods. Additionally, a type can extend another type, enabling
the creation of domestic types based on a common EU-wide type, while preserving
the mandatory claims from the base type. Domestic
types MAY however define additional claims and display information. Details
are defined in [SD-JWT VC].

Requirement PID_14 in ARF Annex 2 defines the base type to be "urn:eudi:pid:1". As a convention, all PIDs must use types in the namespace "urn:eudi:pid:".

SD-JWT VC specifies Type Metadata as a machine-readable format for information
regarding a type, including the information on claims such as what is contained
in this document. Requirement PID_15 in [Annex 2, Topic 3](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2.02-high-level-requirements-by-topic.md#a232-topic-3---pid-rulebook) requires that the information on the
common EU-wide type as well as on any domestic types is published and
accessible in a catalog.

### 4.3 Example

EXAMPLE: The following example shows the payload of a PID in SD-JWT VC format before the encoding into the SD-JWT format.

```json
{
    "vct": "urn:eudi:pid:de:1",

    "given_name": "Jean",
    "family_name": "Dupont",
    "birthdate": "1980-05-23",

    "address": {
        "street_address": "123 Via Appia",
        "locality": "Rome",
        "region": "Lazio",
        "postal_code": "00100",

## 5 PID usage

Users request issuance of PIDs from PID Providers, manage them in their Wallet Unit, and present attributes from a PID to Relying Parties on request.

PID Providers issue PIDs to Wallet Units on request of Users, and revoke them if necessary.

Relying Parties request attributes from a User's PID, and verify their authenticity and validity (including revocation status, if any).

Users, PID Providers, and Relying Parties do this in compliance with all applicable requirements in the [European Digital Identity Regulation] and the corresponding Implementing Acts, as described in the ARF.

Wallet Units SHALL NOT use a PID private key to sign transactional data received from a Relying Party in a presentation request.

## 6 Trust anchors

PID trust anchors are public keys and associated information, needed by Relying Parties to verify the authenticity of any PID attributes they obtain from Wallet Units.

Member States notify each PID Provider to the Commission as specified in the [European Digital Identity Regulation] and the applicable Implementing Acts, including [CIR 2024/2980](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402980). Notification includes the trust anchors of the PID Provider. The Commission will ensure that the trust anchors of notified PID Providers are published in a publicly available Trusted List. Relying Parties can retrieve the trust anchors of all PID Providers from this Trusted List.

## 7 Revocation

PID Providers revoke PIDs, if necessary, in accordance with [CIR 2024/2977](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402977) and with [Topic 7](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2.02-high-level-requirements-by-topic.md#a235-topic-7---attestation-revocation-and-revocation-checking) in Annex 2 of the Architecture Reference Framework.
